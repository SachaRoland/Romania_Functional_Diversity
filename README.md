# Romania_Functional_Diversity
This repository contains the R scripts used to explore the effect of forest structural complexity (FSC) on mammal functional diversity in the Carpathians, Romania.
The data include forest inventories, species relative abundance, microclimatic data (leaf litter thickness, saturation deficit), and counts of tick species at different life stages (larvae, nymphs, adults). 
This project is conducted in the context of an MSc thesis at Wageningen University and Research. 

The main hypotheses tested here are as follows:

H.1
Higher Forest Structural Complexity (FSC) will increase mammal functional diversity, following the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. 
I predict a nonlinear relationship where functional diversity increases with FSC up to a saturation point, beyond which further increases in FSC will not yield significant changes in functional diversity.

H.2
Increased mammal functional diversity will influence the abundance of ticks at different life stages (larva, nymph, adult). 
Specifically, I predict that greater functional diversity will provide diverse hosts, leading to higher tick abundance across life stages

H.3 
Mammal functional traits, such as body size and reproductive rates, will be associated with tick abundance at different life stages (larva, nymph, adult). 
I predict that high densities of small mammals with high reproductive rates will correlate with greater larval tick abundance, while larger mammals will correlate with higher adult tick abundance.

H.4
FSC will influence microclimatic conditions, which will in turn affect the density of ticks at different life stages. 
Specifically, I predict that greater shrub and canopy cover will buffer microclimate (e.g., reduce temperature and humidity fluctuations), 
indirectly increasing tick abundance by creating favorable conditions for tick survival and activity.
